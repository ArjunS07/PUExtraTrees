# A custom fork of PUExtraTrees

This repository is a modified version of the code provided by the authors of [Positive-Unlabeled Learning using Random Forests
via Recursive Greedy Risk Minimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.08461).

The only changes here are in:

1. Some methods of the PUET class such that standard fitting and training syntax can be used.
2. The structure of this project, such that it conforms to the typical syntax of a Python project.

All possible attempts have been made to ensure that the working of PUET here is the same as in the original paper and repository, but please use this code at your own risk. I am not affiliated with the authors of the paper in any way.
